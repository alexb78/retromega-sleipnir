# Planned Features
- more options for button layouts 
- settings with multiple choices (currently toggles)

### User suggestions
 - background image (one for light and one for dark themes)
 - option to use `tile` asset instead of box art in game details

### Low priority
 - Discovery of music files (no need to edit Music.qml)
    This doesn't seem to have an easy solution.
